# Predicting the Results of 2020 U.S. Presidential Elections Using Classification Models 

This project uses data from the US Census Bureau on 3,111 counties to create several classification models that predict the winner of the presidential election. For exploratory data analysis, techniques used involve histograms, box plots, and bar charts. Models used involve random forests, k nearest neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machines, multilayer perceptrons, boosted tree models, decision trees, and ensemble models that combine the previously mentioned models. 

[This project was completed for a Kaggle classification competition UCLAâ€™s STATS 101C Course - Introduction to Statistical Modeling and Data Mining.]
